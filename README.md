This is a SPA (single page application) made to show books.  
## Single Page Book Application  
This is an application I made for books with the help of the MIT | xPro program.  It takes in some aspects of books, like the title and author, and presents each one in a card that is user friendly and helps readers know what the book is about before they buy it.  Plus it looks pretty cool!
